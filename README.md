# ETL-ELT
ETL and ELT searching for relation on guests and rating in Simpsons' seasons.

## Data
I consider [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Simpsons_episodes_(seasons_1%E2%80%9320)#Season_20_(2008%E2%80%9309)) data source.
To avoid the *heavy weight* of copy and paste each data table that contains the episodes for seasons, is better to use a webscrapper.
